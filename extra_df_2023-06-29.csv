Captain Thorn Brenin, the guard Lo Pheng and scribe Hopper Rouley don't yet know that the Reapers have returned and are planning to drown the world in blood so they can awaken the slumbering gods.<br /><br />The story can change at any time depending on your choices, sometimes leading to a character's death. This won't end the game, however, as the narrative continues without the hero but takes into account the consequences of his demise on future events. Don't rely on a single tactic or a powerful team to win the game – the AI in Ash of Gods adapts to your gaming style and forces you to be more cunning!<br /><br />The Ash of Gods graphics are completely hand-drawn with the use of live action video, creating realistic and detailed animations.",https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307rNOdrIlKhhjuAYz7bdHtPAVo4Oh0-pLEMArOM85s0ycogqt3aDhOCOCbuw_YTg4zUEwzdcJ2s55a2UCTC6eC5scM5TX.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/gs2-sec/appkgo/prod/CUSA16018_00/2/i_36434c76e449781785e99131d1ad446113fdc4faa165cc66cb27f4b0954139f2/i/pic0.png,,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307I0zljJzRRnHjOzwAPcjvhRmlyLcZ7lz4IbMOvBTv3i0x2w-vvxVwHMkaZHtkN3JJMTrINoIwBmu-c4ahVbDdtUo1VqD.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307NC1gk99YkIQ_jIO16-QF8FLYMwxa3l87tpRzaXo6Tw07A_cspZDMA7GuKtaMglRJ-jmexCBqt5YX3x9_P5ZLYo7gWP8.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307E76HWmMaBJbnXPP_6UB0FPvMUeNoiPbQ7hF7dpeXqmEGbRPKG3aRSdA4QxWxM4VqSuqgbhQ7SsWcRsYVkVj3lY8HEIu.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307MCBf16r8prcga8L8oLQxltB6Ir1yEXfizQ-paArxdhk3mh5_73fuqT0vOKyH2uOAqgqcJptv-7avutH4E-BPuQTPWC1.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307X4ZL3kH_298UPJFOcIbw7yUWQFN4ZuhV_mYINeufRRskslYyUfY0krooZqqxhj86c76sWVgSuWhXPyjAwcQwfsbAw6w.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307FQJQXhjAKLPGWIqUiEgKm4_k72EZS-hVVi6Vm6BhE0YKmMOxQ1_iP2vzoNdgQdz7C3gQLyLmOz4Dv2SPXzz1doqwK2b.jpg,,,,https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/cfn/11307GMkxyoH8AklGlQQP0LCvwrzsGjr_Kfp5wMXHnh2WxO4pXH9jX_4_NqOjRwiegwiRbc15KG47P4Uo84iYGTnchA7i_xB.mp4,Deep Silver,AurumDust,1,0,0,0,0,2224160768,0,0,1,0,1,0,,,5782,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,CA,2699,2699,2699,8388607,8388607,0,2020-02-03,2023-03-29 15:31:04,2023-04-13 06:59:00,2001-00-00 01:00:00,1,0,UP2047-CUSA16016_00-ASHOFGODSGAME0US,Ash of Gods: Redemption,5571,https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/10307-ash-of-gods-redemption,ESRB Mature,"[""Derramamiento de sangre"",""Lenguaje fuerte"",""Temas sugerentes"",""Violencia""]",0,38,5,3,1,8,50,75,$26.99,$26.99,$26.99,https://store.playstation.com/en-ca/product/UP2047-CUSA16016_00-ASHOFGODSGAME0US,https://platprices.com/en-ca/game/5571-ash-of-gods-redemption,0,,500,19

But that was almost a decade ago, and time had ruthlessly passed them by. Now Sonny and Marty are forced to work together on a case that is weirder than anything they've ever encountered before!<br /><br />NARRATIVE-DRIVEN, DETECTIVE GAMEPLAY<br />Chicken Police is a story-rich and dialogue-heavy game combining elements of the visual novels and classic adventure games. The game has more than 30 characters to talk to, with some having to be seriously interrogated. Collect tons of clues, evidence, and highly sensitive personal information from the shady characters of Clawville to use ruthlessly against them!<br /><br />EXPLORE THE CITY OF CLAWVILLE (again, and again...)<br />There are more than 30 places to visit and some of them will change several times during the story. You can return to previous locations on several occasions, to find hidden secrets, meet new characters and gather information about the world and its inhabitants.<br /><br />A CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE<br />Chicken Police has a weirdly stunning visual style made with the usage of real photos and photo-realistic 3D backgrounds, inspired by classic film-noir movies and influenced by animated features. Its noir mood is enhanced by an original music soundtrack, backed up by professional voice acting for all characters with more than 8 hours of spoken dialogue!<br />Chicken Police is a satire, which recalls the mood and atmosphere of the 40's film-noir movies, and as the best noirs and hardboiled detective stories, it's so gritty and hopeless, that it can only be served with a lot of cynical humor.<br /><br />KEY FEATURES<br />- A thrilling, rich storyline with a classic film-noir twist<br />- Professional voiceover with more than 8 hours of spoken dialogue!<br />- A carefully crafted, """"colorful"""" world<br />- A complex interrogation system<br />- More than 30 unique, fully voiced characters<br />- A cinematic film-noir-like experience with more than 20 cutscenes!<br />- Lots of clues, information, and collectibles to find<br />- A beautiful original soundtrack<br /><br />Offline play enabled",https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202006/1507/AoGvh8gtDY9a5oODZDTarCSD.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202006/1507/TJnzRKVG9o4HT0koWmG7pDn9.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202203/2511/6QIimCDPdj36jAXP5LY7vYJf.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202006/1507/QR8xc6kV3kZQTpc8daGhJTHx.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202006/1507/z8CVoPgviAsdE1TByxrAJHX3.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202006/1507/BBgpb8K4ueFIOOHENvOq1x6j.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202006/1507/DyT17wImcPraS67bS17bTGoq.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202006/1507/hrttv1yaH12e2nuS9izBZEBT.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202006/1507/XAzH0nrHzxtCY2vSHMA0T2oS.jpg,,,,https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202011/0211/se8Vp3MVkDSG9HoDKhBag33b.mp4,www.handy-games.com GmbH,The Wild Gentlemen,1,0,0,0,0,4571070464,0,0,1,0,1,0,,"[""de"",""ru"",""ja"",""en"",""fr"",""hu"",""es"",""zh""]",10475,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,CA,2699,2699,2699,8388607,8388607,0,2020-11-05,2023-06-02 08:48:11,2023-06-13 06:59:00,2001-00-00 01:00:00,1,0,UP0977-CUSA20204_00-CPPIRBASEGAME000,Chicken Police – Paint it Red!,33868,https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/11086-chicken-police,ESRB Mature,"[""Desnudos parciales"",""Lenguaje fuerte"",""Referencia a drogas"",""Sangre"",""Temas sexuales"",""Violencia""]",0,16,9,6,1,2,1,5,$26.99,$26.99,$26.99,https://store.playstation.com/en-ca/product/UP0977-CUSA20204_00-CPPIRBASEGAME000,https://platprices.com/en-ca/game/33868-chicken-police-paint-it-red,0,,500,64

Work together to escape, or stalk and sacrifice every Survivor.<br /><br />This Edition of Dead by Daylight gives you access to a roster of 7 Killers (The Trapper, The Hillbilly, The Wraith, The Nurse, The Hag, The Huntress and The Doctor) and 9 Survivors (Meg Thomas, Claudette Morel, Jake Park, Dwight Fairfield, Ace Visconti, Nea Karlsson, Bill Overbeck, Feng Min and David King). It also includes two cosmetic add-ons packed with outfits for various characters.",https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202203/1520/e6VbPQ56CBzVPgKmWdMMrICz.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/gs2-sec/appkgo/prod/CUSA08444_00/2/i_f9db3c9f5f5941e8029c6b8f71871aea528a9870798a01bf91cda8d0b232ede7/i/pic0.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/2117/OS3ORgaJqaMwQNwH4L6X4z39.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/0120/pWB73K4NAIgqKRa0vTOf682j.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/0120/B7zfCqD6Vx24qPfuv3LimH97.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/0120/l1XdzeAOCSsJFJx0z6beXj3q.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/0120/YhXrhQeHUetWTbDtsjKIfKD7.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/0120/2G2dVB0dOCXrgSPXeGYHgVsK.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/0116/c7bnKjFWp1piL8Wm6WTk0ftB.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/3016/WPXiPGwOw7yTnRPXvnhzZH5O.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/3016/bDeKuL45wC9rB1mM38Nv8aAg.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/0120/CKhN5dhp63kVyZVrCD0HUnY5.jpg,https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202009/2122/Fm3lY5613R40BSYLfeUT4Ho4.mp4,Starbreeze Publishing AB,Starbreeze Studios,1,1,0,0,0,8332312576,27076591616,3,0,5,1,0,"{""0"":""ja"",""1"":""en"",""4"":""fr""}","[""de"",""ko"",""ch"",""ja"",""en"",""it"",""pt_BR"",""fr"",""es"",""zh"",""sv""]",2844,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,6,CA,3999,3999,3999,8388607,8388607,0,2020-11-12,2023-06-07 22:27:24,2023-06-22 06:59:00,2001-00-00 01:00:00,1,0,UP3509-PPSA02048_00-DEADBYDAYLIGHT00,Dead by Daylight: Special Edition,35620,https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/11765-dead-by-daylight,ESRB Mature,"[""Derramamiento de sangre"",""Interacciones online no clasificadas por la ESRB"",""Lenguaje fuerte"",""Violencia intensa""]",0,131,40,1,1,6,100,150,$39.99,$39.99,$39.99,https://store.playstation.com/en-ca/product/UP3509-PPSA02048_00-DEADBYDAYLIGHT00,https://platprices.com/en-ca/game/35620-dead-by-daylight-special-edition,0,,500,92

Tough but fair combat, responsive controls, challenging foes, permadeath and of course, the emergency panic roll to get you out of trouble, make for a demanding, visceral and cathartic action game.<br /><br />Experience a Roguevania, mixing an interconnected world, branching paths and unlockable skills with the constant adrenaline-pumping threat of permadeath.  No checkpoints. You either vanquish the final boss in one go, or you try again. However, you keep some of your progress for successive runs; new paths you've unlocked, access to new levels, mutations, abilities and weapons.<br /><br />Speaking of weapons, Dead Cells features a plethora of ways to slay your enemies. A large variety of swords, bows and of course spells, but also whips, grenades and turrets, each one with its own unique twist. Plus, mutations and scrolls allow you to build and customize your character differently with each and every run.<br /><br />At the end of the day though, it's YOUR skills as a player that matter most! Roguelites are about constantly sharpening your skills, until what was an insurmountable obstacle becomes a walk in the park.

Once unlocked, special permanent abilities allow you to access new paths to reach your objective. Opt for the path that suits your current build, your play style, or just your mood.<br /><br />Exploration: Secret rooms, hidden passages, charming landscapes.

In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop.<br /><br />DESIGNED FOR THE PS5<br />DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5's hardware and graphics to bring Arkane's unique artistic vision to life like never before. DEATHLOOP takes advantage of new cutting-edge features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to make each encounter feel unique and impactful.<br /><br />IF AT FIRST YOU DON'T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN <br />Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you'll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you'll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted.<br /><br />SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER <br />Are you the hero or the villain? You'll experience DEATHLOOP's main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you'll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you're feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna's stylish sneakers and invade another player's campaign to kill Colt.

Androids, who look exactly like human beings, have replaced humans in most tasks: they are workers, babysitters, gardeners, nurses, teachers, clerks. The story of Detroit starts with an unexplained incident that begins to affect the Androids. Some disappear without any explanation, others have unexpected behaviors and strangely show signs of emotions. The rumors of “deviant” androids start spreading, but no one seems to know what's really happening…<br /><br />PLAY YOUR OWN STORY IN DETROIT<br />Detroit is about playing the story. Through your actions and decisions you drive the story and face the consequences of your choices. You are in charge of the fate of these characters. You will become a “co-writer” who will have to make critical decisions that will impact the entire story and its world.<br /><br />As you play as all of the characters, you'll see the story from different perspectives. You will need to weigh each decision, as actions made by one character may have consequences on others. You will also need to avoid putting the characters at risk, because they can all die, and like in Heavy Rain, the story will continue without them.<br /><br />CONNOR, THE DEVIANT HUNTER<br />Connor is the second playable character announced.<br /><br />Connor is an advanced prototype assigned to police forces to help them investigate cases involving deviants. He is cold and analytical; he thinks fast and benefits from some surprising advanced features. He is very determined and nothing matters more to him than accomplishing the mission he was programmed for.<br /><br />BECOME HUMAN<br />Detroit is about emotions, about dilemmas and making difficult decisions. Detroit is not just the story of androids becoming aware of themselves and their fight to be free, it is about a story that resonates at many levels in our world, about being free, about becoming who you are.",https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202010/2119/wl4DB5QGzlEHAXy1KLUVgOAu.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202010/2119/VljHbt4vhc3Bmn8s83kFAPVg.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202010/2119/L8goQzMgY7Y0mbRVs4zOfYPj.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP9000/CUSA08344_00/FREE_CONTENTPVzb98exRn8WZU1L4Goo/PREVIEW_SCREENSHOT1_152767.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP9000/CUSA08344_00/FREE_CONTENTpycSrJhmW7Zlc1DAbWEr/PREVIEW_SCREENSHOT2_152767.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP9000/CUSA08344_00/FREE_CONTENTYNHfiHbJdcpjqMPTbMeO/PREVIEW_SCREENSHOT3_152767.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP9000/CUSA08344_00/FREE_CONTENTbipbqu2tpaRh0iR5OILd/PREVIEW_SCREENSHOT4_152767.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP9000/CUSA08344_00/FREE_CONTENTcM4vDegpC4GHKwsBPtC7/PREVIEW_SCREENSHOT5_152767.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP9000/CUSA08344_00/FREE_CONTENTG9Bl36TLlJiFvxLgmvp8/PREVIEW_SCREENSHOT6_152767.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP9000/CUSA08344_00/FREE_CONTENTomrnmS1eoWiQ748Ahfs5/PREVIEW_SCREENSHOT7_152767.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP9000/CUSA08344_00/FREE_CONTENTkLsHFU54IbfK9jchcPgr/PREVIEW_SCREENSHOT8_152767.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP9000/CUSA08344_00/FREE_CONTENTMILSrP7Zx4Z9d0Eker3S/PREVIEW_SCREENSHOT9_152767.jpg,https://apollo2.dl.playstation.net/cdn/UP9000/CUSA08344_00/FREE_CONTENTnD9LV8iwNFXLLNayDSfS/PREVIEW_GAMEPLAY_VIDEO_152767.mp4,Sony Interactive Entertainment,Quantic Dream,1,0,0,0,0,42411950080,0,0,1,0,1,0,,,5804,,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,CA,2999,1499,1499,8388607,8388607,50,2018-05-25,2023-06-21 15:45:19,2023-07-06 06:59:00,2001-00-00 01:00:00,1,0,UP9000-CUSA08344_00-DETROIT000000001,Detroit: Become Human,7623,https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/7678-detroit-become-human,ESRB Mature,"[""Consumo de drogas"",""Desnudos parciales"",""Lenguaje fuerte"",""Sangre"",""Temas sexuales"",""Violencia intensa""]",0,40,5,3,1,3,16,25,$29.99,$14.99,$14.99,https://store.playstation.com/en-ca/product/UP9000-CUSA08344_00-DETROIT000000001,https://platprices.com/en-ca/game/7623-detroit-become-human,0,,500,107

0,El Hijo - A Wild West Tale,15755-el-hijo-trophy-guide,,,,,w_hj44RKiwM,,,,,,,CUSA17058,"""El Hijo - A Wild West Tale"" is an exciting spaghetti-western stealth game, in which you guide a young boy on his quest to find his mother.<br /><br />As a six-year-old, “El Hijo” must always sneak past the dangers of his world. As he overcomes his challenges, he gains self-confidence, becomes more cunning and, along with it, finds more schemes to get past his foes. His epic journey will lead him through a remote monastery, a harsh and unforgiving stretch of desert, and a frontier town rife with crime and villainy.<br /><br />The journey begins, when a farmer and her son are attacked by bandits who raze their farm to the ground. The mother decides to leave the boy at a secluded monastery to protect him. However, the place doesn't feel right and he plans his escape.<br /><br />“El Hijo - A Wild West Tale” is a non-violent stealth game in which you rely on the mischievous, playfulness of a young child. Using the shadows to his advantage is the core element of the game, as “El Hijo” will often have to hide. Without needlessly adding new mechanics, the gameplay is extended naturally, as variations of existing mechanics are gradually introduced and then combined to increase the challenge. These twists on familiar mechanics are often a product of the varied, increasingly dangerous environments that “El Hijo” must traverse to reach his ultimate goal.<br /><br />- Survive the Wild West through the cleverness of a young hero<br />- Explore dark monasteries, deserts and boomtowns in a spaghetti-western world<br />- Merge with the shadows to hide from the lawless<br />- Solve playfully tricky environmental puzzles<br />- Use an arsenal of tactical toys to bypass and distract diverse desperadoes<br />- Inspire other children to join you on the path to freedom<br />- Enjoy the gripping storyline of a brave son searching for his mother<br /><br />Offline play enabled",https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202006/1019/WYjKQ407XRGoyRypUoBZTrPI.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202102/2417/WoJH2bYNFK6bCpeliuvseV3r.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202102/2417/VwVsAxJs5uHQgNSxFRs7tAl4.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202006/1019/k4zZz7JjwnEOejPvhFD3UFwh.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202006/1019/HglZqMydRJ1Fh1Z7b6jaK6m4.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202006/1019/DG0VvjPyhQtRShVVa2yQDqEN.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202006/1019/wbDMmbIYEbU3W83hTZhBSjGp.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202006/1019/WZ6ZFaTobiOngoOgw3jDnJog.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202006/1019/B8ezEmqC3DG1kfKruLjRd5X8.jpg,,,,https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202103/2314/9ss8ceLLy6reSKr0dfvZXPyU.mp4,www.handy-games.com GmbH,,1,0,0,0,0,3227779072,0,0,1,0,1,0,,"[""de"",""no"",""fi"",""ru"",""pt"",""bg"",""hr"",""fr"",""hu"",""sk"",""sv"",""ko"",""ch"",""el"",""en"",""it"",""es"",""zh"",""cs"",""vi"",""th"",""ja"",""pl"",""da"",""ro"",""nl"",""tr""]",-1,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,CA,2699,2699,2699,8388607,8388607,0,2021-03-25,2023-04-13 20:43:12,2023-04-27 06:59:00,2001-00-00 01:00:00,1,0,UP0977-CUSA17058_00-BASEGAME00000000,El Hijo - A Wild West Tale,68245,https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/12593-el-hijo,ESRB Everyone,"[""Violencia de nivel moderado""]",0,8,7,7,1,3,15,20,$26.99,$26.99,$26.99,https://store.playstation.com/en-ca/product/UP0977-CUSA17058_00-BASEGAME00000000,https://platprices.com/en-ca/game/68245-el-hijo-a-wild-west-tale,0,,500,134

Say goodbye to the complicated command input. The intuitive command called ""Progressive"" will make you play the exact way you want. Players used to traditional style are able to play by using ""Classic"" command input (but we recommend Progressive Mode!). Needless to say, there is Online play. Equipped Ranking system and Leader Board. Training Mode is also substantial. Also, there is ""Casual Match"" where you can fight with your friend 1 on 1 via the network!<br /><br />The original characters from our EX series have powered up and come back for the first time in about 20 years!! You get to see the NEW ""Skullo Dream""! Lovely Hokuto changed to Beauty Shirase! The original characters: Kairi, Shirase, Hokuto, Garuda, Skullomania, Darun Mister, Allen Snider, Doctrine Dark, Blair Dame, Jack, Shadowgeist, Sanane, Hayate...and maybe more!?<br /><br />The new system called ""GOUGI"" is the key to play this game! By meeting certain requirements, the GOUGI will activate, and your character will gain new powers that last until the end of the match. 5 GOUGI make up 1 Deck, and each Deck is different. For example, in the case of using ""Infinity"" Deck; after activating Super Combos 10 times, you will be able to use Super Combos anytime you want! 5 types of GOUGI Decks are included by default, and other 10 types of Decks can be purchased by additional contents. The way you play will be changed by the GOUGI even with the same character.

Living as a man outside the shadow of the gods, Kratos must adapt to unfamiliar lands, unexpected threats, and a second chance at being a father. Together with his son Atreus, the pair will venture into the brutal Norse wilds and fight to fulfill a deeply personal quest.<br /><br /> - Bold New Beginning — His vengeance against the Gods of Olympus years behind him, Kratos now lives as a man in the realm of Norse Gods and monsters. It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive…And teach his son to do the same. This startling reimagining of God of War deconstructs the core elements that defined the series—satisfying combat breathtaking scale and a powerful narrative—and fuses them.<br /><br /> - A Second Chance — Kratos is a father again. As mentor and protector to Atreus, a son determined to earn his respect, he is forced to deal with and control the rage that has long defined him while out in a very dangerous world with his son.<br /><br /> - A Darker, More Elemental World — From the marble and columns of ornate Olympus to the gritty forests, mountains, and caves of Pre-Viking Norse lore, this is a distinctly new realm with its own pantheon of creatures, monsters, and gods. With an added emphasis on discovery and exploration, the world will draw players in to explore every inch of God of War's breathtakingly threatening landscape—by far the largest in the franchise.<br /><br /> - Vicious, Physical Combat — With an over the shoulder free camera that brings the player closer to the action than ever before, fights in God of War mirror the pantheon of Norse creatures Kratos will face: grand, gritty, and grueling. A new main weapon and new abilities retain the defining spirit of God of War while presenting a vision of violent conflict that forges new ground in the genre.",https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202011/1021/X3WIAh63yKhRRiMohLoJMeQu.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202010/2217/KAmUQWQ5V9QF3XDzmty1VkKj.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202010/2217/zMLHwjyNqTFvYHZHEOUIJFUK.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP9000/CUSA07408_00/FREE_CONTENTapPTiEiDhyHa9N8ZEpKs/PREVIEW_SCREENSHOT1_152721.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP9000/CUSA07408_00/FREE_CONTENTtvyAmcevrlRD9G5OC6nH/PREVIEW_SCREENSHOT2_152721.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP9000/CUSA07408_00/FREE_CONTENTJLt9vy2pe5WSLNf4D3AK/PREVIEW_SCREENSHOT3_152721.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP9000/CUSA07408_00/FREE_CONTENTtJ8TeotcxRR8IJLZwKqh/PREVIEW_SCREENSHOT4_152721.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP9000/CUSA07408_00/FREE_CONTENT9KGeWg0TRp7UHDRrVKQf/PREVIEW_SCREENSHOT5_152721.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP9000/CUSA07408_00/FREE_CONTENTBwrUKJPxkKskPhlfZo7s/PREVIEW_SCREENSHOT6_152721.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP9000/CUSA07408_00/FREE_CONTENTFIio77kC7V7MT9CjtkJD/PREVIEW_SCREENSHOT7_152721.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP9000/CUSA07408_00/FREE_CONTENTvegrku5V35gwNNwhWnDZ/PREVIEW_SCREENSHOT8_152721.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP9000/CUSA07408_00/FREE_CONTENTsy0pO6vY6CTPo75EOqCL/PREVIEW_SCREENSHOT9_152721.jpg,https://apollo2.dl.playstation.net/cdn/UP9000/CUSA07408_00/FREE_CONTENTL9JyFUP8hREBssPsCIAt/GOWPS4_ACCOLADES_STORY_30_English.mp4,Sony Interactive Entertainment,SIE Santa Monica Studio,1,0,0,0,0,38733152256,0,0,0,0,1,0,,,5434,,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,CA,1999,1999,1999,8388607,8388607,0,2018-04-20,2023-05-24 19:00:27,2023-06-08 06:59:00,2001-00-00 01:00:00,1,0,UP9000-CUSA07408_00-00000000GODOFWAR,God of War,7605,https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/7523-god-of-war,ESRB Mature,"[""Derramamiento de sangre"",""Lenguaje fuerte"",""Violencia intensa""]",0,22,9,5,1,4,35,45,$19.99,$19.99,$19.99,https://store.playstation.com/en-ca/product/UP9000-CUSA07408_00-00000000GODOFWAR,https://platprices.com/en-ca/game/7605-god-of-war,0,,500,182

Play as Jeff and Debra, two small kiwi birds and the newest hires at the Bungalow Basin Telepost Office.<br /><br />With no hands to help them, the two must work together to jump, flap, peck and butt-slam their way across an interactive landscape of levers, buttons and bells to get the mail delivered on time. From the Dropoff Depot and the Shipping Floor, all the way to the Telegraph Desk and the Cassowary Coop out back, the Telepost is a well-oiled mail-processing machine...well, usually.<br /><br />Overcome Occupational Hazards:<br />Brave inclement weather (and even weirder stuff) while waddling through the Telepost's various mailrooms to ensure the residents of Bungalow Basin get their post. From swirling sandstorms and blizzards, to carnivorous plants and paranormal activity, it's all in a day's work for Jeff and Debra.<br /><br />Team Up or Be Your Own Boss:<br />Take control of both Jeff and Debra, and test your post processing skills in single-player mode, or team up with a friend to tackle mailroom mayhem in online and local co-op modes. No matter how you play, you'll have a little extra guidance from the Telepost's capable staff – a vibrant cast of postal professionals ready to help your kiwis complete their tasks.<br /><br />Collect Stamps to Customise Your Kiwis:<br />Coordinate your kiwis to get messages sent as fast as you can. You'll earn Stamps at the end of each postal shift, which can be used to unlock new wardrobe accessories to customise Jeff and Debra, making them the best-dressed mail birds in Bungalow Basin.

Play the role of a monarch atop their steed and recruit loyal subjects, build your kingdom and protect it from the greedy creatures looking to steal your coins and crown.<br /><br />In the brand-new campaign mode, monarchs must now work to build a kingdom that stands over time until finding a way to defeat the Greed for good. Explore the environments to discover new mounts and secrets hidden in the deep.<br /><br />But you don't have to rule alone! Introducing a cooperative play experience that is totally unique to Kingdom: Two Crowns, monarchs can now choose between a classic solo experience or seek the assistance of a friend, working together locally or online, dropping in or out at will.<br /><br />In addition to the traditional medieval setting, Kingdom Two Crowns also includes:<br /><br />• Dead Lands: Enter the dark lands of Kingdom. Play as unique monarchs, including the Shardbinder Miriam, with powerful traits from the gothic horror action-RPG Bloodstained. Ride the gigantic beetle steed to lay out traps, the eerie undead mount that summons barriers impeding the progress of the Greed, and from Bloodstained the mythic demon horse “Gamigin” with its powerful charge attack. Building your Kingdom has never been spookier!<br /><br />• Shogun: Journey to lands inspired by the architecture and culture of feudal Japan. Play as the mighty Shogun or Onna-bugeisha, enlist the support of the ninja, lead your soldiers to battle atop the mythological Kirin, and form new strategies as you brave the Greed hiding in the thick bamboo forests.<br /><br />We will continue to keep the feeling of exploration, discovery, and strategy alive in Kingdom Two Crowns in post-release updates with more themed settings, each with unique styles that marvel the eye while changing how you rule the lands.<br /><br />A challenge awaits all who seek it here, whether you are a first-time ruler or a long-time fan. So be brave, great monarchs, for in the end Two Crowns shall reign stronger than one!",https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202111/2310/S8MdQILD9cx2ffeNhqNONc93.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202004/0110/oPpvMxjcYYTeZq15X8jHycZq.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202111/2310/B8XoEtMTNQNwvFRrFHrkozpc.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202004/0110/GWf4Am3zUbh6smWmnh30UslH.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202004/0110/5p1AlcODm4Khy1nZqSOq7c0S.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202004/0110/dh4uOJqgfohA05eE4PzG3UNu.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307AhxuBxxyzT1Lz1aSbr1pbC6iCwAv1U0tcgbXyjdHCaw0bGOmcfOGCtJd0PU57P4mVkRtXghXkoJ1FCqo9Cwtu8EQo2S.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307sIcTUPJX_N074ArncL_cQCvtEC42OaHhKB1CBePDqb0BXOU9QT9480uFEC5eY9kyaK69nblQ6eeU6h2xVlr2-QVsooM.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307Neds7kmPpeFbYMYrwk4pnT9Om99bVEnRu7Hd1_FiVyYwJqJC3V0QcmeXYH9iTDwkVsIz_MhT8oEzsnn9vtVH6QfXCel.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/1130709ukFevKaA3toxIvWZ6Ct6TMo_Q8fblwp02jmIVtvXA4hPJJTlyXauACUD2iCPyxpMsivvettOpjc_tsB9cO1ofBu6w.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202004/2011/sJQrtSrkNnmRmXq0ai0l2Yk9.jpg,,https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/cfn/11307A5ELAGx3ERF4TfEUze7dVdtr7AAnmCePDLXFFCiLQrMFGfD4Vc2U9I2NZg2JvNlIHAQBDfxE2CsmlxCBl1bzHwOT1S5.mp4,RAW FURY,Noio,1,0,0,0,0,915341312,0,1,2,2,1,0,,"{""0"":""en"",""2"":""fr"",""3"":""es""}",7022,,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,CA,2699,2699,2699,8388607,8388607,0,2018-12-12,2023-05-24 19:09:26,2023-06-08 06:59:00,2001-00-00 01:00:00,1,0,UP2320-CUSA13597_00-KINGDOMTWOCROWNS,Kingdom Two Crowns,5897,https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/8539-kingdom-two-crowns,ESRB Everyone 10+,"[""Violencia de fantas\u00eda""]",0,11,20,5,1,4,20,25,$26.99,$26.99,$26.99,https://store.playstation.com/en-ca/product/UP2320-CUSA13597_00-KINGDOMTWOCROWNS,https://platprices.com/en-ca/game/5897-kingdom-two-crowns,0,,500,236

Rubber ducks and dressers, drones and electric guitars, scooters and other wonderful goods can be created from many different materials and sold for hard cash – cash you invest right back into your factory to get more machines, more workers and grow your business. In Little Big Workshop you become a factory tycoon!<br /><br />Real factories - made FUN<br />You are the Big Boss and it's time to take charge of your very own tabletop factory. Organize the factory floor, manage your workers, purchase machinery, and design efficient production lines - all within the time-limit and to your client's satisfaction!<br /><br />An open-ended sandbox-experience<br />Take it easy, it's a sandbox-experience where you think, ponder and poke at things until you get it to work the way you'd like. Supply products to clients and an ever-changing market, as you produce over 50 unique product types, built from multiple parts and pieces - all of which can be created with different materials and production methods. No two factories should ever look the same.<br /><br />Tiny hands, big dreams<br />Start out with just a small workshop and expand to a desk-filling factory. Unlock ever fancier machines, add even more production methods, and most of all, more room. Soon enough you'll be running multiple production lines, producing hundreds of advanced products each day, and watching with joy as your cute workers do the actual work.<br /><br />Features:<br />• Varying industries and a wide range of products<br />• Focus on practical problems, not on values, economics, or logistics<br />• Organize all steps of the production on a blueprint<br />• Factories grow as you unlock more desk space<br />• Fully simulated Day/Night-cycle<br />• Take care of your workers!

The future has turned out much darker than anyone could imagine. First, there was the Nanophage. A digital plague that killed thousands upon thousands of those who chose to augment their minds and bodies.<br /><br />Then came the War, leaving both the West and the East decimated and shattered. With no one left to seize power, corporations took over and forged their own crooked empires.<br /><br />You are a tool of corporate oppression.

Delve into these twisted neural mazes and search for clues that will help you find the elusive killer.

0,Paradise Killer,,,,,,00000000000,,,,,,,PPSA04458,"An island outside of reality. A rogue human civilization hoping to resurrect dead alien gods. A murder behind locked doors.<br /><br />Paradise is an island that regenerates every few millennia. The psychic power that the alien worshipers within release into the universe is meant to feed and eventually resurrect their fallen deities. But this force also attracts undesired interest from demons, who eventually corrupt each island — until a new alternate reality is birthed by the Council.<br /><br />The system isn't perfect, but it will be one day — on Perfect 25, the next island-to-be. But on the eve of rebirth, the Council is murdered and Paradise is killed.<br /><br />In the aftermath, the “investigation freak” Lady Love Dies is summoned from exile to find the culprit. This is the crime to end all crimes.<br /><br />What are the facts? What are the truths? Are they the same?<br /><br />PARADISE ON PLAYSTATION<br />Paradise Killer arrives ready for PS5 with a full complement of next-gen features and enhancements, including 4K60 with ray tracing, haptics & controller feedback, “day/night” cycle light bar support, super fast loading, activities and more. Paradise Killer also offers a suite of accessibility options that allow you to tailor the game to suit your needs.<br /><br />BREATHE LIFE BACK INTO PARADISE - Build an airtight case against whoever you think is the killer. Only when someone is successfully convicted can the crime be considered solved.<br /><br />FACT AND TRUTH ARE NOT THE SAME - There are many possible killers, and many ways to build a case. Even if you make a convincing case and get someone convicted, is the mystery really solved?<br /><br />EXPLORE AN ISLAND FULL OF SECRETS - Paradise is set in an alternate future history filled with cryptic lore and mysteries. Examine bizarre relics to learn about this world's surreal history.<br /><br />FIND YOUR PARADISE - Everyone has a secret to hide and something to gain. Old friends become new suspects—choose between the evidence, the greater good and your own beliefs.<br /><br />GATHER EVIDENCE - Let Starlight be your guide through another dance of an investigation. Collect evidence, record testimony and interpret the facts to form your own truth.",https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202112/0102/xfLf4KRuKBl8xsaM3yFoxQo6.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202111/1605/nzOSPHYPhPhoFrpZXSl5QgO8.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202111/1605/zqv2xRr7oEe293x9aTepMk5l.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202202/2203/pFXJ3wjtQor12uIWNGjhKy3E.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202202/2203/TnpjodNCFg9EYmS0ZOz8JWhT.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202202/2203/BIVUl1b7XidOesSFkjYF6zII.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202202/2203/xwmGuBxF5SSd036TbARnVuvu.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202202/2203/x6vAmf8kiYNUMlj5vKarPUu3.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202202/2203/8h4O6G3iHntOvz9rHIGVZ7Cd.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202202/2203/lMuhwFpMNJADQV1PwCQQBAyw.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202202/2203/IwqMDryinrevmHYAAsOWPl2B.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202202/2203/fz8yscey9KqaFf6oxRtSKTJw.jpg,https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202203/1007/oAzbW9Ra4dhfLHVY0dEseZK7.mp4,SURPRISE ATTACK DBA FELLOW TRAVELLER GAMES,,1,1,0,0,0,2309095424,2081751040,0,1,0,1,0,"[""en""]","[""ch"",""ja"",""en"",""zh""]",-1,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,CA,2699,2699,2699,8388607,8388607,0,2022-03-15,2023-05-24 19:28:40,2023-06-08 06:59:00,2001-00-00 01:00:00,1,0,UP5480-PPSA04458_00-3260471775930387,Paradise Killer,85423,https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/15697-paradise-killer,ESRB Mature,"[""Derramamiento de sangre"",""Lenguaje fuerte"",""Temas sugerentes"",""Violencia""]",0,22,15,2,1,-1,-1,-1,$26.99,$26.99,$26.99,https://store.playstation.com/en-ca/product/UP5480-PPSA04458_00-3260471775930387,https://platprices.com/en-ca/game/85423-paradise-killer,0,,500,310

One daughter could be vampiric Ranger, while another could be a vegan Chef. It's a new experience every time. RL2 also lets you play how you want to. Go hard and fast, and dive deeper into the depths of a randomly-generated world. Or take it slow and steady and build your character up until you're ready for greater challenges.<br /><br />WHAT'S NEW IN 2<br /><br />Every Adventure is Unique<br />New monsters, traps, and layouts await you every time you enter the Kingdom. This is a world where improvisation, not memorization, is the key to success.<br /><br />Wildly New Classes<br />No two classes play the same. Hide atop Ivy Canopies as the Ranger and rain poisoned arrows down on your foes. Take to the skies as a Dragon Lancer, striking enemies at massive speeds. Or sing and dance through danger as the joyous Bard. RL2 supports 15 new classes, with 15 distinct styles of play.<br /><br />Brand New Style<br />Rogue Legacy 2 features 2.5D stylings, with 3D characters against hand-drawn backdrops. The art uses heavy shading and all animations are done using stepping techniques to keep the familiar Rogue Legacy look and feel.<br /><br />Revamped Biome Generation<br />Biome generation in RL2 will feel completely new, as each biome adopts different “build strategies” to create completely unique randomly-generated regions.<br /><br />True Metroidvania<br />To really push the metroidvania flair, RL2 introduces heirlooms: special items that permanently give your heroes new abilities and fundamentally change the way you play. Prove your worth, provided you can uncover the many heirlooms.<br /><br />Traits 2.0<br />Though fun the first time, traits in RL1 often wore their welcome later in the game. We've now added gold modifiers to entice players to take on new challenges. The more debilitating the trait is (in-game), the bigger the reward. This makes choosing your heirs a meaningful decision every time.<br /><br />Relics and Resolve<br />One of the most exciting new features to Rogue Legacy 2 is the ability to pick up Relics, which are unique items that change how your run is played. Gain stat modifiers, complete special challenges, and even gain brand new abilities as you traverse the kingdom. But be careful, the more Relics you obtain the more your resolve is shaken, and all Relics are lost if your hero perishes.<br /><br />Improved Accessibility<br />Rogue Legacy 2 takes accessibility to the next level with the introduction of House Rules. Toggle contact damage, tweak global damage and health, and even give yourself flight for difficult platform sections. You have complete control over how you want to play the game.  Also introduced are new mechanics such as Off-shore Banking to give struggling players more ways to succeed.<br /><br />Rich Narrative & New Game+<br />Beating the game once is only the beginning. Learn about the inevitable collapse of a once-thriving kingdom, and discover the dark secrets of the ones responsible, while you connect and build relationships with the characters you meet along the way. The new and expanded lore to RL2 runs deep as you continue to explore and discover multiple playthroughs in NG+. Choose how the game gets harder, from unique biome hazards, to special boss fights. The experience keeps changing for near infinite replayability.<br /><br />More of Everything<br />The sequel adds more of everything people loved from the original Rogue Legacy. More traits, spells, classes, biomes, enemies, equipment, rooms, story. More secrets... Just more everything.",https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/2315/370f9bc417f347c5e73fbdda450758ea4b04022d234b0e28.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/2315/b3fbbdb7589a029e1cb57e5d1c2c2f5402bb3dadc670605d.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/2315/060ba13ac019d8da88afb817f7a40fcf40ba1c6ab4441c7c.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/0615/2a537e23a68255325a598803262ed7e049c6087a832f8dab.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/0615/67a6c6bb8ed54fc7ee270a9a27c42f3a0064a0a5d8c5f59f.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/0615/1c73ff78e88c23caac65c528a7edee1c7976a11577b607ac.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/0615/437ea05b989542526b4417fc20e04598a2b6b5f14e83471d.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/0615/75b95b3a4d29b2f49e6ec00089aa93fca34fadd81ee303b5.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/0615/fefb838a27e0b58cea0d1f3613ed08f7452661567caea4d6.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/0615/aa643f432d6057b0d9c06f1352d8f7c06b1846ed77cf9a45.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/0615/49764e03b2c99a0743dd75e7ec7ffe1fb129b10b2635172c.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/0615/6e37ef0c4064ee3effd4b883c78540c7b85b108895bab708.jpg,https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202306/0615/46ce646dfb7f2be84b7a14195ee5f0c5756d2bab75df823a.mp4,Cellar Door Games,,1,1,0,0,0,973340672,932380672,0,1,0,1,0,"[""en""]","[""de"",""ru"",""ko"",""ch"",""ja"",""en"",""it"",""pt_BR"",""fr"",""zh"",""es"",""tr""]",-1,,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,CA,3349,3349,3349,8388607,8388607,0,2023-06-20,2000-01-01 00:00:00,2000-01-01 00:00:00,2001-00-00 01:00:00,1,0,UP4488-PPSA15173_00-0338975894246736,Rogue Legacy 2,109972,https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/22624-rogue-legacy-2,ESRB Everyone 10+,"[""Humor negro"",""Sangre moderada"",""Violencia de fantas\u00eda""]",0,20,13,4,1,-1,-1,-1,$33.49,$33.49,$33.49,https://store.playstation.com/en-ca/product/UP4488-PPSA15173_00-0338975894246736,https://platprices.com/en-ca/game/109972-rogue-legacy-2,0,,500,343

As humanity entered this new era, deranged mutants known as Others began to descend from the sky with a hunger for human brains. Highly resistant to conventional attack methods, extreme measures needed to be taken to battle the overwhelming threat and preserve humanity. Those with acute extra-sensory abilities, known as psionics, were our only chance to fight the onslaught from above. Since then, psionics have been scouted for their talents and recruited to the Other Suppression Force (OSF), humanity's last line of defense.<br /><br />Featuring a dual story, begin your adventure with either Yuito Sumeragi, an energetic recruit from a prestigious political family or Kasane Randall, the mysterious scout whose power and skill has gained great notoriety among the OSF. As their different experiences interweave with each other, it is only then that you will reveal the full story and unlock all the mysteries of a Brain Punk future caught between technology and psychic abilities in SCARLET NEXUS.<br /><br />Offline play enabled",https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/1100/R9Qab0osYhWXi0djq8ZatRLi.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/1100/zidgrWpnTju9PlOZgefehHuf.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202011/1204/fLZuqoihzAHeTQmVkHd6RhoR.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/1107/SRYedyOpzcIRxtwJk2LCSEkV.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/1107/fO5y9wXwmWbzR0SS5v5oXgtU.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/1107/A1ZEwBfK0etic7XUGx7KhypO.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/1107/rS72vZKyj2dBgQPdvYpPTHl8.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/1107/X4PsobfvMBNKW7ciU27p87x6.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/1107/8JUscahNtDhTBynGUGjfIcHL.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/1107/BbB5Uc6T1FieH0bQCEf2UbI2.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/1906/zmyIQTnctWBGzTXRFsAXh1Qr.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/1906/ODeNgDRot14DIioTTRFZ0yKV.jpg,https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202103/1703/ZSRtC7MemByLrDAZp5ex1Mi2.mp4,BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment America Inc.,,1,1,0,0,0,17284333568,15252455424,0,1,0,1,0,"[""ja"",""en""]","[""es_MX"",""en"",""pt_BR"",""fr""]",-1,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,CA,7999,1599,1599,8388607,8388607,80,2021-06-25,2023-06-21 17:16:05,2023-07-06 06:59:00,2001-00-00 01:00:00,1,0,UP0700-PPSA02211_00-SCRLTNXS00000000,Scarlet Nexus,67736,https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/13198-scarlet-nexus,Apresenta:,"[""Lenguaje moderado"",""Referencia al alcohol"",""Sangre"",""Violencia""]",0,42,8,2,1,3,50,75,$79.99,$15.99,$15.99,https://store.playstation.com/en-ca/product/UP0700-PPSA02211_00-SCRLTNXS00000000,https://platprices.com/en-ca/game/67736-scarlet-nexus,0,,500,350

The legendarily challenging single-player strategic survival simulation game!<br />You are a captain in the United Defense Force, captain of your own star ship. Recruit your crew, customise your ship and head out to explore the galaxy, defending Earth against the mysterious extraterrestrial threat, known as the Phasmids! There will be challenges ahead. Crew members will be lost. Dangerous missions must be undertaken. Galactic Legends will be made!<br /><br />Travel through the galaxy to defeat the threat to humankind across a range of sorties, including reconnaissance, bounty hunts, reclamation and NEW Away Team missions. Train your crew into an elite fighting force from Captain to Comms Officer to tackle stressful and deadly situations such as fighter attack and ship invasions, whilst also repairing systems and putting out the odd fire or two! Customise and upgrade your spaceship with improved weapons, armour, engines and more (even a custom paint job for extra style!)<br /><br />Android Ambush<br />Android Ambush is a brand-new campaign to add to the core Space Crew adventure. Take on a droid army led by rogue androids, previously allied with the United Defence Force! Battle against a whole host of new Enemy Champions and ships across a new star system with new gear, liveries and upgrades available for victorious Captains to unlock. However, these androids don't play by the same rules as the phasmids, so you'll have to re-write your tactics from scratch.<br /><br />Away Team Missions<br />Leave your ship and venture on foot with three of your crew onto outposts and large vessels in the all NEW Away Team missions, discoverable across both Space Crew campaigns. Selecting the right team will be critical for survival as Away Team missions can consist of exploration, puzzles, or combat… sometimes even against the clock!<br /><br />Legendary Crew Members<br />A Legendary Edition needs legendary crew! Build and personalise your ultimate crew by rescuing and discovering legendary crew members with amazing abilities and superior stats. However, you won't just be able to recruit these one-of-a-kind crew members, you'll have to find them during rescue and Away Team missions or unlock them using codes from community competitions.",https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202110/1115/4R2BJtrSoadbILtRg2jCpk2s.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/0816/hwVgUGwhO73FqO2ZtEtMLtij.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/0816/uYP9hImp7ciE1g4cl2f84q7f.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/0816/gOBqLtyxmvsJYvPDNVoGWou4.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/0816/gFw7tWbCiWQwoKIjdWHO2oG5.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/0816/t9jxDg9n6DRTHmJcnY5iysx5.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/0816/NQJJiZZGUthNZPJi9kCC1RO0.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/0816/BmMVDxiTNzfCeq5mM1yVLv8f.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/0816/E7Vt7duebWL6TsAwSDx9Iq8K.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/0816/QI8bZ0PtuuYLMbgx6MbX1G91.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/0816/AtRAmaVH66wQXjHVgSgTHVTP.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/0816/uXnCBHvKWvfyTvD3nQ1eeUy5.jpg,https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202010/1508/YQ7QEcjORVY2VYyClXX0Ol5p.mp4,Curve Digital,Runner Duck,1,0,0,0,0,696188928,0,0,1,0,1,0,,"{""0"":""ko"",""1"":""ch"",""2"":""ja"",""3"":""en"",""4"":""zh"",""5"":""de"",""6"":""ru"",""11"":""pt_BR"",""12"":""fr"",""13"":""pl"",""15"":""es""}",10297,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,CA,3349,3349,3349,8388607,8388607,0,2020-10-15,2023-04-28 19:21:05,2023-05-11 06:59:00,2001-00-00 01:00:00,1,0,UP4395-CUSA18162_00-SPACECREWUS00000,Space Crew,7052,https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/11519-space-crew,ESRB Everyone 10+,"[""Violencia de fantas\u00eda""]",0,13,12,5,1,5,20,25,$33.49,$33.49,$33.49,https://store.playstation.com/en-ca/product/UP4395-CUSA18162_00-SPACECREWUS00000,https://platprices.com/en-ca/game/7052-space-crew,0,,500,365

There is only one option: They'll have to split all bubbles and free their friends on the lower floors. Along the way, who knows what they might encounter…<br /><br />Arcade Mode<br />Be sure to check out the party mode that comes with mutators which add another layer of chaos.

There are no zombies -- only you, the cold, and all the threats Mother Nature can muster.<br /><br />STORY MODE<br /><br />The episodic story-mode for The Long Dark, WINTERMUTE, includes four of the five episodes that form WINTERMUTE. Episodes 1+2 were given a complete overhaul in December 2018, as part of the Redux Update: new mission structure, story beats, dialogue, animations etc.<br /><br />EPISODE ONE - “DO NOT GO GENTLE”<br /><br />Bush pilot Will Mackenzie (player character) and Dr. Astrid Greenwood are separated after their plane crashes deep in the Northern Canadian wilderness in the aftermath of a mysterious flash of light in the sky. Struggling to survive as he desperately searches for Astrid, Mackenzie comes across the small town of Milton, where he begins to understand the scope of this quiet apocalypse.<br /><br />EPISODE TWO - “LUMINACE FUGUE”<br /><br />Mackenzie's search for Astrid takes him deeper into the savage Winter wilderness. A mysterious trapper may be the key to finding Astrid, but can he be trusted?<br /><br />EPISODE THREE - ""CROSSROADS ELEGY""<br /><br />In the aftermath of events in Milton, an enigmatic stranger rescues Dr. Astrid Greenwood (player character) from near death. Facing the blizzards of Pleasant Valley, Astrid must bring all her skills as a doctor to bear on the survivors she encounters. But will she find Mackenzie, and get closer to the mystery that's taking them to Perseverance Mills?<br /><br />EPISODE FOUR - ""FURY, THEN SILENCE""<br /><br />A murderous gang of convicts has captured Mackenzie. Desperate to escape one of the darkest corners of Great Bear Island, he must somehow survive his fiercest enemy yet. Can Mackenzie recover the Hardcase, continue his search for Astrid, and also save the innocents caught up in this deadly confrontation?<br /><br />The first four episodes of WINTERMUTE represent approximately 30 hours of gameplay. Episode Five is included in the price of the game, and will be unlocked for free as they are released.<br /><br />SURVIVAL MODE<br /><br />Survival Mode is the free-form, non-narrative survival sandbox that has been honed over nearly three years in Early Access.<br /><br />Survival is your only goal, and death your only end. Make your own survival story with every game.<br /><br />NO HAND HOLDING<br /><br />The game challenges players to think for themselves by providing the information but never the answers. You have to earn the right to survive.<br /><br />PERMADEATH<br /><br />When you die in Survival Mode, your save is deleted. Every decision matters. [Note that WINTERMUTE does not feature permadeath.<br /><br />CHOOSE YOUR EXPERIENCE<br /><br />Four distinct Experience Modes let you find a challenge level you are comfortable with, such as Pilgrim Mode, which is meant to be quiet and pensive, all the way to Interloper Mode, where only the most experienced survivors have a chance to last a week. If none of the four Experiences suits you, use Custom Mode settings to tailor your Survival Mode game to your specific tastes.<br /><br />Features the music of Sascha Dikiciyan.<br /><br />Enhanced game play on PS4 Pro console",https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202109/2306/ChPARRL6cgDRc3GuWkLZOZIa.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/gs2-sec/appkgo/prod/CUSA09690_00/2/i_620588e3b1e6e722ef3da53a8d883f6e2d6bc33a29e3c3c06841980a20b1fce7/i/pic0.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202110/1922/w7SW2CjmbkPBwR1cJlaSjsUP.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307Y0967ElMe_TTURNNQUIuDIPtGhSecQOTKYNsAxlV6vkLjzRvdLOrngUH9JY5k1e9lyu8WEqH3HphTwc8JfPYloLg5zu.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307mmw-tBRK0M-OivAw38KUJBAHkzewnofu7UVARo305HkQgBHL2c11PX9fSGq9x0SOrFmLXlZGhzGSMrU-VKaOHUS4kUp.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307Q4Mzrdnj03iZ_bKCOt_7foEQ8MmWw2Nfj0KbSLezSNQE2QFJVv6z4ZKSBM9h5xtW1j52eLnQhBQWucbh_ZUQ_As2GhO.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307MGcps7BPOuXmL-nZWlFgBY7uJynD_7chwogOVtKRApMfWrqENx15GG0Qw6_yyQPQDZ29InDJlV8GbtXtlUaybs3Ktie.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307-C5XivPr515J7pFmyFqL5Zt8eYiSjDh7xKgTela-fQA9cVIfrJXtFcds8BXSqrGzJb7PFuT6XvU9OIYPejT_B0evYx2.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307VrHSHV_MyXbp7E5KXpncswydYxnjkZ3sIon7UBb0M1ouqZVu9zPTkWqz1E-P6y-YXB_r7v_dHH8pwB8o3bVs8AHuNtD.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307BgH5eXh3qheiQFsDwpm9VSgiAiHo4GNFOSJWyeM_T-gSQS9mmShALFF9Bi5K9fPCWToBpqsAUcNTGngKicd6G85L_4p.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307SLAMtk1SjLxEzp8tqQQBXpWgsvRQWMf8Ro4PFjLdyf481WQt56zgm_-k6MzbJzpcGFs3Gruh9jJT7uOxgKcRD0k5Cc3.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/113075iVAb_i8dm9ExVKi_m5bRGjvb5mp6Tiy9MnCLnejmdco5kJgu5n4y8lRmnr2kNh1H43PnSxO-6z5Kkw_wWWbbU7y_Zy.jpg,https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/cfn/11307KeaX_5j-kKjoQAOAwFa5UgoOloMZFqZeMowgr-tmyT0WOV9RiY7Kw7r_bSAVzWAzOlKbooj_ilEKCquDGgLFSw4uzmu.mp4,Hinterland Studio Inc.,Hinterland Studio Inc.,1,0,0,0,0,5631180800,0,0,1,0,1,0,"[""en""]","[""en""]",4403,,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10,CA,4699,2349,2349,8388607,8388607,50,2017-08-01,2023-06-21 17:43:46,2023-07-06 06:59:00,2001-00-00 01:00:00,1,0,UP2982-CUSA08624_00-TLDRKFULLGAMEPS4,The Long Dark,6163,https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/6432-the-long-dark,Apresenta:,"[""Viol\u00eancia"",""Linguagem Impr\u00f3pria""]",0,25,12,3,1,10,150,250,$46.99,$23.49,$23.49,https://store.playstation.com/en-ca/product/UP2982-CUSA08624_00-TLDRKFULLGAMEPS4,https://platprices.com/en-ca/game/6163-the-long-dark,0,,500,405

The risk to be caught by patrolling National Socialists, looking for people who publicly stand against their point of view. The risk of being beaten up or even killed by the German military because we‘re opposing the regime. The risk of losing everything, including our loved ones. This is how we live. This is how we try to survive. Through the darkest of times.<br /><br />Plan, Act, Survive<br />You are the leader of a small resistance group in 1933's Berlin, of ordinary people, from Jews to Catholics and Communists to Patriots who simply can't stand aside. Your goal is to deal with small blows to the regime – dropping leaflets to spread awareness about what the Nazis are really up to among the people, painting messages on walls, sabotaging, gathering information and recruiting more followers. And all of that while staying undercover – if the regime's forces learn about your group, the life of each member is in grave danger.<br /><br />Experience history<br />Through the Darkest of Times is a historical resistance strategy game, focusing on conveying the somber mood of the period and the very real struggles of average people living in the 3rd Reich. Historical accuracy means that your small group of resistance fighters will not change the outcome of the war, nor will you prevent all of the Nazi's atrocities, but you can certainly do everything in your power to save as many lives as you can and oppose the fascist system wherever possible.<br /><br />Features:<br />• Experience the Darkest of Times in 4 chapters<br />• Fight for freedom, weaken the regime and lead your resistance group<br />• Plan activities, find collaborators and try not to get caught<br />• Feel the weight of responsibility as you make difficult decisions and face the dire consequences<br />• Beautifully illustrated expressionistic scenes and events",https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/0807/pmwogeYLYtOPdNYJRAnjvmm9.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/0807/mMfZ76KGeEuoGkZlPoezvYIy.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/0807/PPNQnICxwUzbSUpNPM4UlmOD.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/0807/EIqDKCnzp3SVmeDLkKr3DrRr.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/0807/ImtRGXxNQXoAgpWGZOiAM8qJ.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/0807/DO8ETrmdP7kapbjgrQCGbi4v.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/0807/76N2bEQMDylPcTaeqRDHJ0Xd.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/0807/iJlf1DMzbAfnPGmPKb1MtlXi.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/0807/tVBJrzGFOTUWl9DbJVzsjsnQ.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/0807/tD5LIisKDkigjI38ej3HpXbn.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/0807/s0grfsPb0OLkJB300jBREDly.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/0807/O75tfW5MPVE5LOeiTlHa2EkP.jpg,https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202008/1116/W01RmVVlZPFTpsthKYMgsINE.mp4,www.handy-games.com GmbH,Paintbucket Games,1,0,0,0,0,742653952,0,0,1,0,1,0,,"{""0"":""ja"",""1"":""en"",""2"":""zh"",""3"":""de"",""4"":""ru"",""7"":""fr"",""8"":""es""}",8913,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,CA,1999,1999,1999,8388607,8388607,0,2020-08-13,2023-06-07 22:41:43,2023-06-22 06:59:00,2001-00-00 01:00:00,1,0,UP0977-CUSA20142_00-TTDOTBASEGAME000,Through the Darkest of Times,4696,https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/11246-through-the-darkest-of-times,Apresenta:,"[""Lenguaje"",""Sangre moderada"",""Temas sexuales de nivel moderado"",""Violencia de nivel moderado""]",0,34,15,1,1,2,40,-1,$19.99,$19.99,$19.99,https://store.playstation.com/en-ca/product/UP0977-CUSA20142_00-TTDOTBASEGAME000,https://platprices.com/en-ca/game/4696-through-the-darkest-of-times,0,,500,421

When the price of alchemy became too steep, attempts to halt its use were made, each as woefully unsuccessful as the last, with the catastrophic consequences felt across the realm. Within days, the kingdom fell to chaos, infected monsters prowling the blood-soaked streets, all hope of a cure lost.<br /><br />Corvus is the kingdom's final hope, the fate of Hermes resting in his feathered hands. The truth is buried deep in the memories Corvus left scattered throughout the punishing world, and only by collecting these lost memories can the kingdom be saved, but each time he dives back in, trying to piece together the truth, all he finds is more secrets.<br /><br />Key Features<br /><br />Harness the plague: Seize plague weapons from gruesome bosses and formidable enemies, wielding them as deadly weapons.

Your team starts at the bottom, but you may be invited to take part in the major races if the organisers see that your results are good enough. <br />You can create and gradually level up your own rider in Pro Leader mode as you strive to become the next cycling legend to compete with the likes of Primoz Roglic, Tedej Pogacar and others. You can choose from four different profiles: climber, sprinter, puncher and versatile. Your choice will be crucial if your aim is to win a Grand Tour or be a specialist in the Classics!<br /><br />Create your own Tour<br />My Tour mode has been redesigned to offer you more freedom. With the new interface it is now easier to customise your ""My Tour"" (rest days, stages, teams). You can now choose the list of participating teams and national teams. Choose from 89 stages to create your race.<br /><br />Enjoy a wide range of content<br /><br />The game includes the 19 World Tour teams and their jerseys as well as the teams Alpecin-Fenix, B&B Hotels P/B KTM, Team ArkÃ©a - Samsic and Total Direct Energie. There are also many official races (Paris-Roubaix, Paris-Nice, LBL, etc.)<br /><br />More realistic peloton<br />We have redesigned the actions of riders in the peloton to recreate the behaviour found in real races:<br />-Favourites ride closer to each other<br />- The yellow jersey is better placed at the front of the peloton<br />-Pursuit of the early breakaway is more realistic with fewer teams getting involved, which gives the leader's team the upper hand, just like in real life<br />- Teams that want to catch the breakaway but don't attack or that reduce the peloton in the race on the flat now have consistent behaviour<br /><br />Revamped objectives<br /><br />Before the start of each stage, you can now set the objective for each rider thanks to a new ""Select Rider"" page, which includes all the information you need to make a choice (ranking, role, race-day condition). Your choice obviously influences the behaviour and decisions of riders during the race.<br /><br />A new recovery mechanic<br />Our aim is to offer better visibility of change in condition and to give more importance to riders that recover well in the Grand Tours. <br />Recovery between stages and races is crucial for the success of your riders. In Tour de France 2021 , we have developed a recovery profile based on the recovery rating. The lower the rating, the more the recovery profile penalises the race-day condition.",https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/2611/mDRlUb0UyukoAVgxgkjKZ1CF.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/2611/nXImQcRXcQHPoeYu3VzZjzKx.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/2611/cow6zBcptzDHsbtH3aX9KO4x.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/2611/0jbINRPtaLc6nzlaAohsQYWK.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/2611/O0L4nEhxp0lNu8Z71yLTwsNS.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/2611/aTxjGVNMItsx9ylHuYaNPkyL.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/2611/JxSr9jCrho74fXiAXQUwhV3N.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/2611/TIfSHltx6fr2FBAOGHOaoc3w.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/2611/5plBSIimxNU7aagPLYWbMJ8y.jpg,,,,https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202106/0307/NX5XMqJOBklAmwShwN2PTvXd.mp4,NACON SA,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,,,-1,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,CA,6699,6699,6699,8388607,8388607,0,2021-07-01,2023-05-10 17:58:47,2023-05-25 06:59:00,2023-05-16 17:00:00,1,0,UP6665-PPSA03341_00-TDF2100000000000,Tour de France 2021 PS5,72195,https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/13308-tour-de-france-2021,,,0,18,21,1,1,3,8,10,$66.99,$66.99,$66.99,https://store.playstation.com/en-ca/product/UP6665-PPSA03341_00-TDF2100000000000,https://platprices.com/en-ca/game/72195-tour-de-france-2021-ps5,0,,500,433

Purge the unclean with the most powerful agents of the Imperium!<br /><br />Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor – Martyr is grim action-RPG set in the violent 41st millennium, when the galaxy is at constant war. Become a mighty Inquisitor and carry out the Emperor's will. Choose one of the multiple classes and take part in brutal combat encounters: embark on a huge variety of missions with your fellow agents and fight through the single-player story campaign set on a haunted fortress-monastery which hides a terrible secret from the past of the Inquisition.<br /><br />THE NEXT MILESTONE IN THE EVOLUTION OF ARPGS<br />The first Action-RPG set in the grim future of the 41st Millennium takes the genre to its next level: an open-world sandbox game with a persistent universe with a huge variety of missions, tactical, brutal combat encounters in destructible environments and a storyline influenced by the community of players. Use the cover system for tactical advantage, perform executions in epic boss battles and become a Protector of any solar systems with your glorious actions!<br /><br />INQUISITORS: SECRET AGENTS AND SPECIALISTS<br />Forge your own playstyle with different character classes and specializations: hold your ground with the Crusader Inquisitor while enemies close in on you, bring in your finesse and cunning with the Death Cult Assassin background, or use the unspeakable powers of the Warp with the Primaris Psyker background. Choose from three specializations for each classes that fit your playstyle.<br /><br />TRAVERSE A WHOLE GALACTIC SECTOR<br />Explore the Star Map of the vast Caligari Sector, travel in different subsectors and explore an immense amount of solar systems, visit a growing number of unique points of interests: investigate on different planets with distinctive terrain conditions, fight your way through corridors of infested Void Stations, abandoned Star Forts and other diverse environments!<br /><br />FIGHT THE CORRUPTION TOGETHER<br />You can go solo as a lonely Inquisitor, but you can also assemble a team of your friends! Play missions in co-operative mode with up to 4 team members, blast away your foes together claiming great rewards, and form Cabals to gather your close allies! Inquisitorial Cabals are groups of Inquisitors working together. Cabals can progress just like characters do, and being a member can often grant special missions. The Inquisition has a lot of different factions with different agendas, and Cabals sometimes clash with each other in the shadows.<br /><br />IMPROVE YOUR WEAPONS, CRAFT MISSIONS AND TWEAK YOUR SKILLS<br />Looking for a specific loot or reward? Use Uther's Tarot to set the conditions of your next mission, collect Blueprints and use Crafting to improve your equipment, and use the Inoculator to fine-tune your different skills. Choose your loadout to your advantage for each mission!<br /><br />A LIVING, EXPANDING WORLD<br />Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor – Martyr is an ever-growing, long-lasting experience. Expansions and regular free updates will introduce new enemy factions, new terrain settings, new missions and mission types, new story-driven investigations and new gameplay features. Seasons are big, free updates that will introduce longer story arcs in which players can shape the persistent world of the Caligari sector with their actions.

Inspired from arcade side scrolling arena shooters like Cabal, Natusme's console release had it all; Wild Guns was a Co-op Western Steampunk gallery shooter with slick controls, amazing aesthetic, and a rewarding challenge.<br /><br />Players control their character through arena style stages where movement is only limited to left and right; verticle movement comes from agile jumps - absolutely essential when dodging an onslaught of enemy fire. There's a cursor onscreen which acts as a targeting reticle, and this can be controlled to shoot down foes or even lasso them for a moment's breather. It's interesting to point out that Wild Guns probably had the most destructible environment in any SNES game, and behind the bottles and neon signs, there are a wealth of secrets to find. At the end of each stage, players will encounter massive bosses for a great twitch based finale of frantic shooting, rolling, and leaping.<br /><br />As a re-release, changes include new stages with their own bosses, a wider variety of weapons, online rankings, and the addition of 4 player single-screen gameplay. And just to be thorough, Natsume has thrown in 2 new characters, a daschund who controls an attack drone, and a really buff baby faced man who could actually just be a really buff baby ;)<br /><br />To see that after 22 years, and completely out of the blue, having this cult title recieve a revival in Wild Guns: Reloaded is a wonderful thing for gamers. In the landscape of overly cinematic unfulfilling handholding quasi-narrative driven fetch quests that seem to be the popular at the moment, it's games like this that remind us of what games use to be: pure fun!",https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP1014/CUSA05135_00/cF1EBJbpL25UFqLFilxY6zybKLnjRffs.png,https://image.api.playstation.com/gs2-sec/appkgo/prod/CUSA05585_00/2/i_cd9422dbe454d95399ab04f82826d91c378310dc27e96165b89c49af5347fd37/i/pic0.png,,https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP1014/CUSA05135_00/FREE_CONTENTi7aE7bmglu9mJ6D2PDdy/PREVIEW_SCREENSHOT1_132312.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP1014/CUSA05135_00/FREE_CONTENTbZM48vuZXg22xk3BMwS2/PREVIEW_SCREENSHOT2_132312.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP1014/CUSA05135_00/FREE_CONTENTJ5ZYseMXmxLPkjk8kc9Y/PREVIEW_SCREENSHOT3_132312.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP1014/CUSA05135_00/FREE_CONTENTuuyMgCaVnh2hEBrpffIz/PREVIEW_SCREENSHOT4_132312.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP1014/CUSA05135_00/FREE_CONTENTxPJ4LXxYx7h1l6VfxIYC/PREVIEW_SCREENSHOT5_132312.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP1014/CUSA05135_00/FREE_CONTENTsmBR6QVUAnSFpVel87tc/PREVIEW_SCREENSHOT6_132312.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP1014/CUSA05135_00/FREE_CONTENTnEsu8crBpCNUTjvdLKgH/PREVIEW_SCREENSHOT7_132312.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP1014/CUSA05135_00/FREE_CONTENTM17qR75pBvXOqDBexeBE/PREVIEW_SCREENSHOT8_132312.jpg,https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP1014/CUSA05135_00/FREE_CONTENT9Yi0j40WDimXdkFrOoK8/PREVIEW_SCREENSHOT9_132312.jpg,https://apollo2.dl.playstation.net/cdn/UP1014/CUSA05135_00/FREE_CONTENTK0DiYTxsviJrcZmtVPJB/PREVIEW_GAMEPLAY_VIDEO_132312.mp4,Natsume Inc.,,1,0,0,0,0,182910976,0,1,4,0,1,0,,,3689,,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,CA,2699,1349,1349,8388607,8388607,50,2016-12-20,2023-06-21 15:40:56,2023-07-06 06:59:00,2001-00-00 01:00:00,1,0,UP1014-CUSA05135_00-NATPWILDGUNS0001,Wild Guns Reloaded,4760,https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/5667-wild-guns-reloaded,ESRB Everyone 10+,"[""Violencia de fantas\u00eda""]",0,17,1,0,0,9,15,50,$26.99,$13.49,$13.49,https://store.playstation.com/en-ca/product/UP1014-CUSA05135_00-NATPWILDGUNS0001,https://platprices.com/en-ca/game/4760-wild-guns-reloaded,0,,500,472
